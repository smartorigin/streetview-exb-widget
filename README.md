## About

![DemoGif1](./docs/assets/Demo1.gif)

This widget brings Google Street View into your ArcGIS Experience Builder applications. Click anywhere on the map to see street-level imagery, or open Street View directly from feature popups.

## Features

- **📍 Map Integration**: Click anywhere on the map to instantly open Google Street View at that location.
- **🖱️ Popup Actions**: Integrates with ArcGIS popups, adding an "Open in Street View" action to your features.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Offers two viewing modes:
  - **Reduced**: A non-intrusive floating panel, perfect for desktop use.
  - **Expanded**: A full-height side panel, optimized for mobile devices.
- **⚙️ Configuration**: Includes "Click-to-view" and "Popup-action" presets to quickly set up the widget for your specific use case.
- **🔗 External Links**: Option to open the current view directly in Google Maps for further exploration.
- **🌍 Internationalization**: Fully translated into French (`fr`) and English (`en`).
- **🎛️ Floating Control Panel**: An optional toggle button to enable/disable the widget on the fly, keeping the UI clean when not in use.

## Prerequisites

What you will need to use this widget:

**A Google API Key**

The widget uses Google's [Maps Embed API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-started) to display Street View imagery.

1. Head to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project (or use an existing one)
3. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Library** and enable **Maps Embed API**
4. Go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** and create an API key

> [!NOTE]
> You'll need billing enabled on your Google Cloud account.

## Usage

The widget can be used in two main different ways, choose preset your prefer through the widget's settings tab in experience builder.

### 👆 Click-to-view (default)

Any click on the map opens Street View at that location in a floating panel, this is the default preset.

> [!NOTE]
> You can toggle the widget on and off through a floating control panel at the bottom right of the screen

### ▶️ Popup action

Street View opens only when you click the "Open in Street View" button inside a feature popup. Map clicks work normally without triggering Street View (you can still enable it through settings).

> [!NOTE]
>
> ![DemoGifPopupAction](./docs/assets/DemoGifPopupAction.gif)

> [!TIP]
> The "Open In Street View" action will still be present in the default "Click-to-view" mode, this mode exists specifically for users who do not wish to use the map click feature or see a permanent control panel
